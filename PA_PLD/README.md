# Photoacoustic imaging with PLD array
This folder houses all the functions needed to perform photoacoustic imaging using a pulsed laser diode array triggered by a laser driver. 

## Setup and Imaging
This section guides the user to save the matlab variables required by the Verasonics software using the associated acquisiton scripts. The acquisition script is set up to acquire high frame rate (up to ~5000 Hz) PA images where real time image visualization will look "jerky". To reconstruct all acquired frames, the associated "RECON" script must be utilized. The setup files are written for the L7-4 linear array transducer, which the user must change if a different transducer must be used. The user can then follow the steps below to perform PAI,
