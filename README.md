# BFIL Lab: Verasonics Functions 
This is a repo of some of the MATLAB functions used for photoacoustic (PA) imaging using the Verasonics system. Here, a optical parametric oscillator (OPO) pump laser and pulsed laser diodes triggered by a laser driver were used for sample irradiation. These comprise acquisition scripts and other functions that can be used for streamlined data analysis.
