# BFIL Lab: Verasonics Functions 
This is a repo of some of the MATLAB functions used for photoacoustic (PA) imaging using the Verasonics system. Here, a optical parametric oscillator (OPO) pump laser and pulsed laser diodes triggered by a laser driver were used for sample irradiation. These comprise acquisition scripts and other functions that can be used for streamlined data analysis. The repository assumes that all the files are saved to the user's local system and added to current MATLAB path.
